The past two months have been quite a journey for me. With just six months to my graduation, I grew as a professional, who is about to enter the Technology Industry. The experiences I had were absolutely enriching as it put some things about the Industry in perspective. All I could hope for now, would be to be contradicted about those odd bad experiences, when I start with my professional journey.

Let me plot out these two months for you, for I'm sure a lot of people would love to know what I experienced about the Indian Tech Scene. I don't know how closely the Indian scene resonates with the world, but there are a few major issues with the Indian ecosystem, which I feel, needs to be addressed as soon as possible. I will bring them up as we get to it in this narration. Other than that, my journey has been primarily an introspection, helping me to understand myself better as a professional.

## The Search
It is really tough to find an internship in India. By an intern, I obviously mean a productive one, with good exposure and decent stipend.

> The assumption that an intern cannot add value immediately to any organisation is utterly frustrating

It is seldom the case that people invest money into interns. Rather than making an assumption that an intern cannot add value immediately to any organisation, if companies take hiring interns a little more seriously, and a bit more professionally, the returns would be immense.

On top of that, I personally went through the an entire hiring process for a winter intern, not even reimbursed for the travel only to be rejected because I asked for a decent wage for the skills I possess. And to think the startup demanded complete allegiance to them, putting their interests over my career. At this point of I felt like that interns were such a win-win, but for the employers.

At the end of the day, I was able to secure an internship. Sadly, it were not my skills, but my contacts which helped me land that intern. I was always of the opinion that your skills speak for themselves, but I never quite stopped for a second to think to whom. The search made me realise the importance to network and the need to interact and build connections with people associated with my Industry.

## Hackerrank Connection
I also had the opportunity to be called on for the on-site round at [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/aboutus) for their full-time software developer role. It is my first such experience and my second interview round ever. The first one was with [Smartprix](https://www.smartprix.com/about/us), wherein I secured a campus placement.

As excited as I was about the fact that my trip to Bengaluru would be completely reimbursed, I was pretty confident about getting the job as I was confident with my knowledge base. What transpired was a disastrous interview on the topics I was supposedly good at according to my profile.

> Over-confidence is the death of any skill or knowledge

Maybe I was not good enough, or maybe I lacked professional experience to be considered for a full-time role. What I learned from that interview was the fact that you cannot control external agents, so why stop doing what you love, in my case, that being developing and experimenting with frameworks and technologies.

## Expressions 101
My intern required a Python developer when I joined them. By the time I was done with the intern, I had successfully changed their requirement to a JavaScript developer.

The project involved me working on creating desktop interfaces using [Kivy](https://kivy.org/#home). But upon studying the codebase and spending some time on the tasks assigned to me, I was damn sure about the framework being a dead end. This was my third day at my intern and I was thinking to myself whether I should infact let the guys know that it would be really very difficult to progress in the direction they've proposed using Kivy, adhering to the timeline. I had an alternative ready. I always wanted to hack on [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) but never quite went through with the feeling. This was a chance to pursue that but I was in a fix as I thought to myself whether it would be wise to disrespect all the hours of work the team had already put in, in building the product to the point where I joined them.

> Never underestimate your ideas. You might be sitting on a gold mine

I took a leap of faith and decided to go with my gut feeling. Outcome - people were very receptive of my proposal and I started porting the code to Electron immediately. Changing the platform from Kivy to Electron not only helped them to reduce their MVP (Minimum Viable Product) time, but it also offered them the stability and support that came along with using Electron, a framework built by GitHub.
If I hadn't decided to express myself that day, the product wouldn't have reached the stage it has when I left the reins of the Electron app to the guys at [HelpMeBuild](http://www.nuovotec.com/).

## Of Travel and Discipline
Before my intern, I was never the one to travel to work. But during my winter intern, I had to travel twenty-two kilometers every week to my office. At first it was annoying and later it became stressful. But with time, I began to settle into the schedule making me all the more productive.

> Monotony is a rhythm in itself, a perfect event-loop in execution

For a lazy person like me, the monotony of the schedule helped me become more responsible and in control of my day. I feel it to be a stepping stone to becoming more professional by being better at managing myself and the limited time I have.

By the time my intern got over, getting to the office to test the product I was building made me look forward to traveling to the office and getting back to my family after a day's work made to look forward to traveling to home.

## Tech Talk
I was lucky enough to interact with [Prakash](https://www.facebook.com/prakashkumar09), who told me all about the Indian Startup Ecosystem. Really enjoyed getting know about how to differentiate promising startups from all the others, not to mention the detailed lessons on how fundings work. He was truly a great person to work under, giving me enough space to take ownership of my work but yet maintaining control by keeping track of my progress. I hope to work with him soon.

I spent my one month at HelpMeBuild on building an IoT product, based on Electron. As I claimed earlier that I always wanted to hack on Electron, but it was this intern which finally helped me realise that.

> I want to dedicate this quote to Electron, just because it's &hearts;

I would love to share my experiences with Electron with all you guys, but I suppose this post is way past an average attention span. Will definitely document them some other time.

Thanks for stopping by!
