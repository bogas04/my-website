This was the first time I participated in a Hacktoberfest, although oddly enough, I never knew that something like that existed, otherwise I would have claimed some two three t-shirts by now ...

Personally, I found the opportunity to be really fruitful and helped me finally be at ease with the open source community. It is really tough for someone new to open source to get a break that helps them get over the _'am I good enough for this'_ misconception. I myself struggled for around two years until I recently got to interact with the amazing people at [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/about) and then got acquainted with Hacktoberfest.

## What is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source, sponsored by [GitHub](https://github.com) and [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).

All you have to do for participating in the event is to open [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) in open source projects that is, contribute. Your contributions can be anything, from bug fixes to improving documentation.

Each contribution is you giving back to open source. It has been a wonderful thing for all of us in developer land. I credit everything I know to open source. And as a push for shy souls like me, so that you might go that extra mile in making substantial contributions, you get a Hacktoberfest t-shirt.

Somebody sure knows how to get developers going!

## Tryst with Hoodie

Over the course of Hacktoberfest, I got myself acquainted with an organisation called [Hoodie](http://hood.ie/). I would like to acknowledge the amount of effort they put in for making Hacktoberfest a lovely experience for contributors.
One of their team, [Gregor Martynus](https://github.com/gr2m) is probably one of best people I've interacted so far!

He was all over the pull requests the entire duration of the Hacktoberfest, helping out and reviewing code brought in by contributors. It was really inspiring to see him manage all that and yet keep it all together somehow. More power to him!

Hoodie is an open source framework facilitating the creation of out-of-the-box offline-first applications. Their codebase is in JavaScript and hence me stumbling upon it.

I got to work on refactoring their application's [logging functionality](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie/pull/598) which was out-of-date. A special mention to [Rob Capellini](https://github.com/capellini) as well, for being there and helping me see this fix through.

I also undertook an [issue](https://github.com/hoodiehq/camp/issues/22), requiring me to build a simple default UI for the accounts route. I am intending to finish it up in a week or two.

Hoodie's [open source presence](https://github.com/hoodiehq) is probably one of the most contributor friendly organisations out there and they would like nothing more but to get more passionate contributors.

## Testing, for the win!

I had always loved running unit tests on some of my personal projects but to be honest, I found them really cool and hence I did it. But during this Hacktoberfest, I [got to learn](https://github.com/paazmaya/yaml-validator/pull/6) the real strength of writing good tests and providing coverage.

Testing, specifically isn't an after thought, but a plan. Through testing, you can model the behavioural aspects of your code/project and build the functionalities iteratively, until you pass your tests satisfying all your goals.

It let's you plan your functionalities and their ideal behaviour.

Although, once you are through an iteration of your project, tests, then play out another crucial role of maintaining the stability of your project. Tests make sure you don't make changes that break your core functionalities. This seems preposterous for someone new to software development, but mind you, when codebases become too large and their are multiple people working on some code that they didn't write, the only thing keeping everything together are the tests!

## A friend in need is a friend indeed

I had always wanted to help someone with their open source projects, someone just like me, looking to be heard in the open source community. And thus I took the opportunity Hacktoberfest provided me, in helping out a person with his [project](https://github.com/cezarlz/boss-validator).

Turns out it feels really rewarding to be involved in someone else's project, not to mention the amount of joy it brings the person whose project is getting the attention. We as a community can do atleast that much for each other, by being appreciative of the work being done for the community. Open-Source is all about collaboration, the desire to code and the want to give back to the society. Let's always stay true to the roots.

## We've been hacked!

With so much of positivity around, Hacktoberfest also had it's share of people trying to score an easy t-shirt. There were so many bogus pull requests opening everywhere. Repositories, whose only purpose was to write your name in a list to get an easy contribution and people forgetting common courtesy and crossing-over someone who has already claimed an issue by making a PR for the same.

DigitalOcean and GitHub have been quite lenient with the specifications of this event and although it is not easy to validate each and every pull request made, it would have been much better to have some level of check on such insincere contributions.

## All's well that ends well

Whatever may be the hacks, Hacktoberfest has been a blessing to the community. My only regret is not knowing about it in the previous years. Afterall, the real prize of Hacktoberfest is something much more valuable than a mere cotton thingy.

See you at the next Hacktoberfest!
