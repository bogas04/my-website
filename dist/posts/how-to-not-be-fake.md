### Humans are flawed.

Yes, this is not some news. This is something everyone comes across through education whether schooling or literature.

And yet people procrastinate each day trying to vye for their "perfection" and what not. Because the fact remains and so do we as foolish as ever. We only hear or acknowledge what we want to and choose to ignore the most important thing when it comes to dealing with this imperfection within us; the course of action.

**Learn to deal with it.**

You see that.

You decide to move on.

Now you're subconsciously trying to erase it from the memory. Because your mind isn't much sport about being told that it's not as brilliant as it's supposed to be. It's probably why human emotions are heart-felt and not mind-felt. The so called practicality is almost a corrupted version of achieving wholeness, comprising of the "cosmetic" aims and ideas we humans generally lay out to overcome our shortcomings.

It's time I invested some time in myself and for once take a stand against hiding my own self from me.
Because you're fake as long as you deny yourself the opportunity to come clean and face your supposed flaws. Embrace them and learn to be considerate to others. We are supposed to be a community, tolerant of each other and accommodating. I suppose that was the intention for us; so that in our shortcomings, we decide to surround ourselves with people who complement us. This symbiosis was probably the prize of our existence and we have wandered way too far.

Flaws are here to stay.

So are you.

As they say; it's never too late.
