## What is AWS?

**A**mazon **W**eb **S**ervices is a cloud services platform providing clients [IaaS](http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/Infrastructure-as-a-Service-IaaS), [PaaS](http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/Platform-as-a-Service-PaaS) and [SaaS](http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/Software-as-a-Service) solutions.

It is because of such diverse offerings, AWS holds a huge market share for cloud computing and services.

Some of the big companies that use AWS are
* [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/)
* [Adobe Systems](http://www.adobe.com/)
* [Expedia](https://www.expedia.com/)
* [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/)
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)

## Why move to cloud?
Cloud is omnipresent.

In layman terms, it acts as a centralized data/service dispenser.

And obviously some of those dispensers may need some money to dispense whatever they are offering; but for our modern society, data and time are the most valuable assets we possess. Cloud helps us to maximize just that and hence the dispenser justifies any expenses incurred on it's behalf.

Cloud provides
* Latest technology updates to you
* Improved reliability
* Technological abstractions, so that you worry about less
* Convenient scalability
* Failure recovery
* Better return on investments than in-house alternatives
* A global scope

## Show me what you got
Amazon Web Services offers a broad set of global cloud-based products including compute, storage, databases, analytics, networking, mobile, developer tools, management tools, IoT, security and enterprise applications.

### Some of the frequented services are :

* **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud**

    Or [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2) is a web service to create, manage and assume control of virtual machines in the cloud. It is an _Infrastructure as a Service_ solution to provide computational resources for hosting applications/softwares.

    EC2 is one of the core offerings of AWS supporting a lot of companies and developers.

    PS : This website is hosted on an EC2 instance!

* **Amazon Simple Storage Service**

  Or [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3) is also an _Infrastructure as a Service_ cloud storage solution, providing remote storage infrastructure, improved agility and availability.

  Amazon S3 provides cost-effective object storage for a wide variety of use cases including backup and recovery, nearline archive, big data analytics, disaster recovery, cloud applications, and content distribution.

* **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**

  [Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk) is a _Platform as a Service_ offering by Amazon Web Services.

  It abstracts away the pain of setting up a production environment to host your applications, a step one needs to perform manually on infrastructure services like EC2.

* **Amazon ElastiCache**

  [ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache) is an in-memory data store or cache in the cloud.

  It supports data stores like [Redis](http://redis.io/) and [Memcached](https://memcached.org/), facilitating fast information retrieval in comparison to disk-based databases.

* **AWS Lambda**

  [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda) is a relatively new offering by AWS, gaining traction with the advent of [server-less applications](http://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html).

  It is a completely abstracted backend solution where you just have to worry about the code and nothing else.

* **AWS CodeDeploy**

  [CodeDeploy](https://aws.amazon.com/codedeploy) is _Sofware as a Service_ offering, allowing automatic code deployments and continuous integration to hosting instances.

  This service is built for scalability, deploying new releases on entire clusters, watching failures and minimizing errors due to improper builds.

AWS has a lot more to offer and I sure would need an entire lifetime to master each service. All the best if you decide to go that way friend!

## Competition
Cloud computing is a very lucrative and innovative field.

Therefore, there are a lot of other businesses apart from AWS bringing in some serious hardware and services for their cloud offerings.

### Azure
[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) is the cloud services platform by Microsoft. It is gaining immense popularity with cloud service users and is the most profitable cloud services platform at the moment.

### DigitalOcean
[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com) quite an established start-up in the cloud services sphere.

It intends to simplify web infrastructure and help build products that developers love.

### IBM Bluemix
[Bluemix](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/) is a cloud platform that helps you solve real problems and drive business value with applications, infrastructure and services.

Bluemix also facilitates interacting with IBM's AI [Watson](http://www.ibm.com/watson/).

### Google Cloud
[Google Cloud](https://www.google.com/cloud/) is a Cloud services offering by, yeah, you guess it, Google.

### Heroku
[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is a cloud Platform-as-a-Service supporting several programming languages and being used as a Web Application Deployment model.

... and many more.
