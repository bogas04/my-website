Defense of the Ancients, or what people call DotA is a real-time online strategy game. It boasts of over 12 million unique players around the globe and I happen to be one of them.

So the deal with this game is quite simple and straightforward.

You install it.
And then you happily watch your life burn.

They should have put a disclaimer on the website about this.

"Virtual narcotics! Administer on your own risk"

But then, I'm damn sure the folks at Valve Corporation (volvo in dota lingo) had a vendetta against productive minds doing productive things. For they wouldn't have had this product listed free on the steam store.

You play as a team of five against another team, trying to control the map as much as possible by destroying enemy structures and in the process pushing out the "lanes".
Lanes are basically roads which connect the bases of the two teams, where the main structure i.e. the ancient, is present.
The goal is to destroy the enemy ancient before they can destroy yours.

All the ten players in a game pick a [hero](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Heroes) from a pool of over 100.  This hero is the unit a player will control when the game commences.
Each hero has unique abilities and you can improve them further by equipping them with items bought from the in-game gold which one can farm through mechanics called [jungling](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Jungling) and [last-hitting](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Creep_control_techniques#Last-hitting).

One doesn't need to be smart to realise the math going on here.

The vast number of choices, the in-game decisions, the gameplay and not to mention, the chance to learn critical words in different languages (one should always be able to tell a greeting from a curse) makes this THE game to get addicted too.

The verdict?
Go get some Dota! It's worth it.

PS : I'm a Dota nutcase, so I'll probably be posting some DotA to document my affair with this beautiful game.
